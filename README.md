# Extendify (WIP)

Enhance your Spotify experience with custom plugins.

The best [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app) alternative in [a familiar way](https://vencord.dev).

# Inspirations

This project was largely inspired by [Vencord](https://vencord.dev).
A large part of this codebase is just a modified version of Vencord.
I've added a banner crediting the original source for every file where this is the case.

I also took inspiration from [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app). I just thought that there was a better way to do things.

# Running

If you're on Windows, Extendify requires installing Spotify from the installer. (**NOT THE MICROSOFT STORE!**)

Currently the `applyPatch.mjs` script supports Windows and Linux (tested on Arch + Hyprland).

## Scripts:

- `npm run build`: Build Extendify.
- `npm run dev`: Build, enable devtools and patch Spotify.
- `npm run patch`: Patch Spotify.
- `npm run unpatch`: Undo the patch.

## Flags:

- `--flatpak`: Use this flag when running on Linux with flatpak.
- `--spotifyPath`: Use this flag to specify the path to Spotify's installation directory. (It should contain an `Apps` folder)
- `--cachePath`: Use this flag to specify the path to the cache directory. (It should contain an `offline.bnk` file)

Apply flags like this:

```bash
$ npm [flags] run <script>
```

---

To build, enable devtools and patch Spotify, run:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

To undo the patch, run:

```bash
$ npm run unpatch
```

# Running (Linux + flatpak)

```bash
$ npm --flatpak run dev
```

To undo the patch, run:

```bash
$ npm --flatpak run unpatch
```
